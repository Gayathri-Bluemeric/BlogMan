# Kubernetes Troubleshooting and Performance Optimization User Guide

This user guide provides an analytical approach to troubleshoot issues in your Kubernetes resources. This also highlights the potential areas of performance improvements. Follow the steps outlined for each area of concern and take corrective actions.

  - [3. Kubectl Commands](#kubectl-commands)
  - [4. Flow Chart](#flow-chart)

## 1. Schema Comparison

You can use OpenAPI schema definitions to validate your Kubernetes resources by comparing their current state with the expected state. If discrepancies are found, take appropriate actions as suggested. 

```yaml
# schemas.yaml
CurrentState: |
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  ...
ExpectedState: | 
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  ...
```

## 2. Highlighting Issues and Performance Optimizations

Ensuing the YAML of your Kubernetes resources are correctly written is crucial. Below, you can see part of a YAML file where issues that require attention have been highlighted:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
spec:
  replicas: <Change this based on your requirements>
  ...
```

## 3. Kubectl Commands

To identify challenges and resolve them, run the following kubectl commands:

```bash
kubectl get nodes # Check the status of your nodes
kubectl get pods -n <namespace> # Check the status of your pods in a specific namespace
kubectl describe pod <pod> -n <namespace> # Get detailed information on a specific pod
```

Follow the step-by-step instructions for execution and expected outcomes.

## 4. Flow Chart

Here is a simple process flow chart to identify improvements or issues:

```bash
graph TD
A(Start) -->B{Check Node Status}
B -->|Node in NotReady status| C[Identify Issues]
B -->|Node in Ready status| D{Check Pod Status}
D -->|Pod in Error status| C
D -->|Pod in Running status| E{Analyse Performance Metrics}
E -->|Performance Issues found| C
E -->|Performance is fine| F(End)
C -->|Issues found| G[Take Corrective Actions]
G --> F
```

- This guide does not cover all possible issues or performance improvements within Kubernetes.
- Always validate changes in a test environment before applying them to production.
